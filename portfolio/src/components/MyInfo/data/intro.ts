export const MyDetails = `I build high-performance web platforms with .NET & React that scale securely on Azure — services handling 60M requests/day (1–2ms) and delivering ~40% performance gains.
Solo achievements include rewriting legacy frontends (Angular → React), designing backend architecture and modernizing critical SOAP services to .NET/Azure, leading the BUDDI URL service, migrating reporting to Power BI Service (saving ≈$1M/year after infrastructure changes), debugging critical user-facing production issues, and building new React applications from Figma designs.
I follow clean architecture, CI/CD, and automated testing (Playwright, Jest/xUnit) and use k6/Grafana for performance benchmarking.`;
