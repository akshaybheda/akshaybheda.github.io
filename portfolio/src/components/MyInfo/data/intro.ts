  "Hey there! I love building scalable web applications and high-performance backend systems, ensuring they are efficient, maintainable, and secure. I work primarily with .NET on the backend and React on the frontend, following clean architecture principles and modern best practices. I’m a firm believer in writing            tests—Playwright for integration, Jest/xUnit for unit tests, and k6 (Grafana) for performance benchmarking. Beyond coding, I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing performance, and continuously learning new technologies to stay ahead.";
