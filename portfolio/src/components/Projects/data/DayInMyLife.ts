export const DayInMyLife = "As a senior developer in a team of six, I take on a broad range of responsibilities across multiple web applications — about six in total. While I primarily focus on two, I also contribute to key features in the others whenever needed. Beyond development, I oversee security, ensuring compliance by monitoring and addressing vulnerabilities from Mend/WhiteSource scans and ZAP active/passive scans. I proactively apply fixes to maintain system integrity and keep our applications secure. I’ve been told my role has evolved into that of a 'team enabler' — jumping in wherever I’m needed, solving problems, and helping the team move forward."
